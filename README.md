# Greetings!

🧑‍💻 Full-stack web developer with 10+ years of experience turning ideas into clean, functional websites.  

🔥 Currently focused on building web apps with React and Next.js, using TypeScript for safety and structure.

⚙️ Deployed with Vercel, powered by smooth CI/CD pipelines for fast, reliable releases.

🛠️ I still love the smell of fresh PHP and ACF in the morning—WordPress isn't going anywhere.  

## 🚀 What I Do

- Build fast, responsive sites & landing pages  
- Integrate APIs, CRMs, and weird plugin setups  
- Refactor legacy code without breaking the internet  
- Design scalable systems with a focus on clean, reusable component architecture
